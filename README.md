# Automatic Night Light with LDR & Transistor

This is a basic electronics project that switches on an LED automatically in the dark using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and an NPN transistor.

## 🔧 Components:
- LDR (Photoresistor)
- NPN Transistor (e.g., 2N2222 / BC547)
- 10kΩ Resistor
- 330Ω Resistor
- LED
- 9V Battery

## 🛠️ Features:
- Auto light ON in darkness
- Designed using EasyEDA
- Beginner-friendly circuit for learning analog electronics

## 📁 Files:
- `schematic.json` — EasyEDA schematic file
- `PCB.json` (optional) — PCB layout
- Images and explanation included

## 🧠 How It Works:
The LDR and 10kΩ resistor form a voltage divider that controls the transistor base. In darkness, the transistor turns ON and allows current to flow through the LED.
